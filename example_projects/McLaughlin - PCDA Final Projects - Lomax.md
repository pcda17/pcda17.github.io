## Lomax Speech Study

> For your final project, you will construct a dataset drawn from two or more online sources and analyze those data in a critical essay. You may either present an argument about the data (e.g., describing bias in the way the data were chosen and arranged by a cultural institution) or you may use your dataset as the basis for an argument about culture (e.g., tracing a stylistic shift in a literary community). You should conceive and execute your project with a specific audience in mind, such as literary scholars, newspaper readers, or policy advocates.

> Your dataset should comprise at least 200 texts or other media files, or at least 1000 metadata records. The size of your collection should be appropriate to your technical skills and the complexity of each record. Rather than using a pre-existing dataset, you should extend the collection in some way. This might mean curating material from multiple sources, mashing up two or more datasets, augmenting records using machine learning or natural language processing, or using a creative technique to organize messy data.







## Week 3: To Do Before Class

> Choose an online data/metadata source, preferably one available to the public via direct download or API. Download a sample of the data, at least 50 or 100 records. Read them over closely, noting anything unexpected. Search for information about the dataset's history, purpose, intended audience, and any past uses by researchers or journalists. Describe what you learned in 400–500 words.

## Week 4

>Choose a book-length text (or set of texts) available online with which you are familiar. Following Montfort’s code examples, parse the text using the TextBlob library and run some exploratory tests. In 400–500 words, describe your process and what you learned about the text, emphasizing anything you found surprising. Submit your code in a Jupyter notebook.



## Week 5

>Work through Chris Albon’s Beautiful Soup tutorial.

>Choose an API from the list of examples or choose one that is relevant to your final project. An API with a URL-based interface is preferable. Sign up for a developer key if necessary, keeping in mind that it may take a day or two for your request to be processed. Read the documentation for the API and familiarize yourself with it by running a few sample queries. Then execute a larger query (or series of queries) within bounds you choose, aiming to collect at least 2,000–3,000 metadata records. Verify that your dataset is complete and intact. Transform the data to CSV format and conduct any necessary cleaning in Excel, Calc, or OpenRefine. Post 100–200 words on Canvas about your collection process and results.

## Week 6: Data and Politics

>In 500–600 words, evaluate the “moral dimension” of the dataset you collected last week. Take the [*list of questions*](https://thefrailestthing.com/2014/11/29/do-artifacts-have-ethics/) posed by Michael Sacasas as a starting point, describing any biases, exclusions, or individual interests reflected in the collection. What can't these data tell you? How might they be used or misused?





## Week 7: Statistics and Visualization

>Submit a 500–700-word proposal for your final critical data analysis project. What data will you be using? What kind of patterns are you looking for? What critical lens will you apply? Most importantly, who is the intended audience for your study and why would/should they care about your findings? Describe what led you to choose this project and present any preliminary observations and hypotheses. You should consider this assignment an abstract or partial draft toward your final project. Each student should post the proposal two days before class. You will be assigned another student at random, and you will post a 100–200-word response to that student’s proposal before class.


## Week 8

>Choose an online data/metadata source, preferably the one you’re using for your final project. Using techniques from last week’s readings, present a quantitative exploration of the data using descriptive statistics and two or three visualizations. Up to two of these may be histograms, accompanied by another graphical format of your choice. You may use numerical values included in the collection or quantify some aspect of the data using techniques learned earlier in the course. In 300 words, describe your process and findings. Submit your code in a Jupyter notebook.





## Week 9
>Share your complete, cleaned dataset for the final project. In 200 words, describe the collection and the work you’ve done to shape and/or augment it. Submit a sample of your collection and/or processing code in a Jupyter notebook.




## Week 10
>Choose two machine learning algorithms discussed last week and a set of texts or metadata records, preferably the collection you are using for the final project. In 300–500 words, compare the likely efficacy of the two approaches and discuss how their classifications may differ.



## Week 12: Peer Production & Crowdsourcing
>Report your progress toward the final critical data analysis project in 300–500 words. Note your preliminary findings and describe how your perspective and/or approach has changed since you began.
